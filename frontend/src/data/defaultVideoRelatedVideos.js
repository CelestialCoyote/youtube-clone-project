                "title": "Review of the Top 10 Dog Breeds and Which Breed is Right for You",
                "description": "In this video, we will analyze and review the top 10 most popular dog breeds and explain which dog breed is right for you and your family. \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:26 German Shepherd\n1:27 Golden Retriever\n2:40 Labrador\n3:42 Beagle\n4:47 Poodle\n5:56 Bulldog\n7:11 French Bulldog\n8:18 Rotweiler \n9:27 Husky\n10:40 Corgi\n11:29 Mutts\n\n\nGerman Shepherd\nAs herding dogs in the past, German Shepherds would guide, herd, and protect livestock. Because of this, German Shepherds may sometimes act a bit distant or aloof. They will love you and your family, but they may give all new people the stink eye. German Shepherds respond extremely well to training. \nThese dogs need daily exercise. \nGerman Shepherds shed heavily and frequently. \n\nThe Golden Retriever\nGolden Retrievers are one of the most popular dog breeds and there are many good reasons for that. These dogs are loyal, active, family dogs. \nUnfortunately though, if you are looking for a dog that will protect your family in the event of a break-in, a Golden is not a good choice. \nWhen it comes to energy levels though, Golden retrievers do need a decent amount of exercise. \nBe prepared to groom your Golden often—these pups shed frequently, and heavily. \n\nThe Labrador\n Labs are wonderful pets for families and children, and they play nicely with other dogs. Labs are so obedient and kind that they often serve as therapy dogs for the sick and the blind. \nRemember though that Labs are a large breed and therefore, require plenty of regular, vigorous exercise, in order to stay healthy and fit. \nJust like golden retrievers, labs are notorious shedders and have a double coat which needs routine maintenance and grooming.\n\nThe Beagle\nBeagles are known for their excellent nose and their love to hunt. \nOne of the advantages to owning a beagle is that they are a smaller dog with a shorter coat. If you are living in an apartment situation where you have a size limit, a beagle will likely fit. \nAnd remember, Beagles are very stubborn and can be difficult to train. Their bark may be quite sharp. Beagles have a much shorter coat which means less shedding. \n\nThe Poodle\nPoodles, whether standard, miniature, or toy in size, are easily recognized by their distinctive, curly fur. Poodles of all sizes need to be brushed daily, and keeping the coat neat and attractive involves frequent trips to the groomer. If not cared for properly, a Poodle’s fur can become matted and poorly conditioned. \nThis dog is excellent with children, does everything possible to please its owner, is loving and affectionate, and gets along incredibly well with other animals if introduced while young. Even better, due to their single fur, Poodles shed very little and are, therefore, a good choice for owners who suffer from pet allergies.\n\nThe English Bulldog\nOne of the advantages to owning an English Bulldog is the calm and lazy temperament of the dog. Low exercise requirements allow Bulldogs to be comfortable living in an apartment.\nBulldogs are expensive to purchase and prone to numerous health issues. \nBulldogs shed a moderate amount of hair. They drool often, and tend to be gassy because of their body composition.\nThese dogs seldom bark, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t noisy. Bulldogs make a symphony of snorts and snores. \n\nThe French Bulldog\nFrench bulldogs make excellent pets for city-dwellers, since they rarely bark, are small in size, and require minimal exercise. Frenchies' flat face makes them unable to cool down in hot weather and they need to be protected from heatstroke. \nWhile English bulldogs require 2-3 a week brushing, Frenchies don’t shed much and one brushing per week is enough to keep their coat healthy and free of dead hair. \n\nThe Rottweiler\nRottweiler may become very territorial of your home and family, and will instinctively find it challenging to accept the presence of strangers or visitors. This requires significant amounts of training and socialization to resolve.\nThese pups’ double-coat sheds moderately, and Rottweilers are one of the most expensive dog breeds. \n \nThe Siberian Husky\nHuskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people for sled-pulling, guarding, and companionship. As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; \nThe breed's stamina, extreme intelligence and independent nature makes them very stubborn. \n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis\nCorgis may not be a good fit for bicyclists though because Corgis’ stumpy legs are too short to keep up with the fast pace of a bicycle. \nCorgis are often willing and eager to please, but they have a stubborn streak to them that can sometimes become problematic. These herding dogs require a lot of exercise. \n \nMutts\n\nThese dogs tend to be less expensive and may be less prone to hereditary health conditions. This is because over generations, breeders have perpetuated and magnified genetic flaws in many of the popular purebreds. Pugs, for example, are prone to respiratory problems because of their short nose.",
